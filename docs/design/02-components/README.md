# Components (Skeleton)

Each component should have:

- Purpose and when to use
- Anatomy
- States (default, hover, focus, disabled, loading, error)
- Accessibility (roles, labels, keyboard)
- API (props), theming, and usage examples
- Do/Don’t

Place the spec in `02-components/<Component>/README.md` and link to a Storybook story.
