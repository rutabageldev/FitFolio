# Patterns (Skeleton)

Reusable design patterns with cross-component guidance:

- Forms (validation, inline errors)
- Empty and error states
- Navigation and IA
- Notifications and toasts
- Tables and lists
- Auth flows (passwordless, passkeys)

Each pattern should document rationale, a11y, content rules, and links to relevant
components/stories.
