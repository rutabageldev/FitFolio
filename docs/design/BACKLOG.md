# Design Backlog

Purpose: Keep design-specific tasks focused and prioritized without overwhelming the
main ROADMAP. Promote items to `docs/ROADMAP.md` only when they become cross-team,
cross-release, or product-wide milestones.

## How to Use

- Track granular design work here as checklists.
- File GitHub issues with label `design` and one of: `design:foundations`,
  `design:components`, `design:patterns`, `design:content`, `design:flows`,
  `design:a11y`, `design:rfc`.
- Link issues to checklist items below.
- Review weekly; move completed items to CHANGELOG and promote major items to ROADMAP as
  needed.

## Backlog (Prioritized)

- [ ] Foundations v1 tokens defined (color, spacing, type, radius, elevation)
- [ ] Button spec + stories (states + a11y)
- [ ] Form Field pattern (Input + InlineError + Label)
- [ ] Focus states audit (global + components)
- [ ] Empty/Error states pattern spec
- [ ] Content style guide v1 (voice/tone)
- [ ] Auth flow patterns (magic link + passkeys)
- [ ] Charting approach and palette draft

## Ready for RFC

- [ ] Brand direction proposal (logo, palette direction, typography families)
- [ ] Theming strategy (dark mode, token structure)

## Done (move to CHANGELOG with links)

- [ ] Design docs skeleton and Storybook scaffolding
